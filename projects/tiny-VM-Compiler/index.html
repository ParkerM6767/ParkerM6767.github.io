    <h1>PL/0 Tiny VM & Compiler</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>
            PL/0 Tiny VM & Compiler is a simple compiler and virtual machine for the PL/0 programming language and
            grammar.
            Using the C programming language,
        </p>
        <p> I developed both a compiler that translates PL/0 source code into object code and executable files that
            could be
            run on a virtual machine I made that executes this machine code.</p>

        <h2>Skills I learned:</h2>

        <p>
            Through building this project, I learned about compiler design, virtual machine architecture, and low-level
            programming concepts.
            Working on this project enhanced my understanding of how high-level programming languages are translated
            into
            machine-executable code.
