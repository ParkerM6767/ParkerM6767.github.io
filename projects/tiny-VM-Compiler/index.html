    <h1>PL/0 Tiny VM & Compiler</h1>

    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>
        PL/0 Tiny VM & Compiler is a simple compiler and virtual machine for the PL/0 programming language and grammar.
        Using the C programming language,
    </p>
    <p> I developed both a compiler that translates PL/0 source code into object code and executable files that could be
        run on a virtual machine I made that executes this machine code.</p>

    <h2>Skills I learned:</h2>

    <p>
        Through building this project, I learned about compiler design, virtual machine architecture, and low-level
        programming concepts.
        Working on this project enhanced my understanding of how high-level programming languages are translated into
        machine-executable code.
